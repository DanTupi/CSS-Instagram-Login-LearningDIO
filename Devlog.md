# DEVLOG - INSTAGRAM PAGE

- 2021/01/29 : The only major change I made from the class was the image used to display a Cellphone, from the class we were using a image of just one cellphone, and the image inside the display of this cellphone does not change.

- 2021/01/29 : I saved the background image from the original instagram log-in page and pasted one of the image's assets from the site.

### To do

- Learn and implement the events to change images in the smartphone's display;
- Use a decent image editor (not paint :art: ) and implement the transparency on background.png;
- Don't know if can, but check the "log-in" status to display the Garfield image or the query from user name and password;
